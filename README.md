This program was made independently and created as a way to practice limited skills learnt in CS101.

The program is a series of while_loops and incredibly ineffective.
While it does serve its function, it iterates poorly and relies on Boolean flipping to operate.
It is prone to failure; it does not check for errors and relies on if statements to deal with any incorrect values.
